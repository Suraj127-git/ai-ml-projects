## Usage

```python
import joblib

# Load demand forecasting models
models = joblib.load('demand_forecasting_models.pkl')

# Load optimization results
optimization = joblib.load('inventory_optimization_results.pkl')

# Load ABC analysis
abc_analysis = joblib.load('abc_analysis_results.pkl')
```

## Training

To retrain the models, run:
```bash
cd notebooks
python train_inventory_models.py
```
